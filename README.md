-----------------------------

Here, in this is the easiest project.Creating a simple comsole chat cot will do wonders to guide ypu through the basics of coding and project making.

During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implemeny to your bot.

Your Simple Chatty Bot must chat like:

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2018.

What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Say me reminders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
->1 2 1
Your age is 22: that's a good time to start programming!
Now, I will proove to you that I can count to any number you want.
->3
0!
1!
2!
3!
Let's test oyur programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To determine a program into several small subroutines.

Coffee Machine
--------------------------

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don't have to make yourself. It's enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

In This project, you will see working of a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification.You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappucino and latte. Since, nothing's for free, it also collects the money

```
Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit): remaining

The coffee machine has:
400 of water
540 of milk
120 of coffee beans
9 of disposable cups
$550 of money

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit): buy

What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappucino: 2
I have enough resources, making you a coffee!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit): buy

What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappucino: 2
Sorry, noy enough water!

Write action (buy, fill, take, remaining, exit): exit
```
